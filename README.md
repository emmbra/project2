# Project 2: Fresh Lemons - Movie Rating App

[Run Wild - Trail Run Finder](https://eb-movie-rating-app.herokuapp.com/)

## Description
Created a react Movie Rating app with the following features:

* Users can search for a movie and view the following information about that movie:
  * Movie Title, Poster, Director, Rated, Genre, Year, and Plot
  * IMDB Rating, Rotten Tomatoes Rating, Metacritic Rating

* Users are then able to give the movie a Fresh Lemons rating and denote whether the movie is sad, funny, action, or romance.

* Users can then view all movies that have been rated on Fresh Lemons and delete movies based on movie ID.


## Technologies

* MySQL
* Express
* React
* Node.js
* Semantic UI React
* HTML5
* CSS3
* JavaScript
* Open Movie Database API


## Challenges

In total this project took three collaborators about 60 hours to build including all the time put into research and trial & error.

Difficulties included:

* First time using React so our initial design required tweaking throughout the process as we figured out how to manage states and pass down props from parents to children.

* CSS styling. Many hours were spent using the inspector tool and adjusting CSS settings to align elements on the page.

* Keeping the code DRY. We had to refactor containers and components when we repeated ourselves and learned a lot about changing components to containers and vice versa as needed.

* Git errors required many hours of troubleshooting to resolve.
